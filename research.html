              <h2>Gas-Surface Interactions</h2>
              <p></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify">
                Gas-surface interactions play an essential role in momentum and heat transfer characteristics in the rarefied gas 
                flows that are typically encountered in high-altitude space vehicle dynamics and MEMS/NEMS applications, such as 
                internal flow through a micro/nano channel. In such applications, the mean free path of gas becomes comparable to the 
                characteristic length scale of the system leading to failure of continuum-based solvers due to dominant effects from 
                the surface on the flow physics. The existing mesoscopic flow solvers such as Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) 
                have the capability to depict the flow physics accurately, but they require accurate gas-surface interaction models. 
                In such a situation, atomistic methods, such as the classical molecular dynamics (MD) method, can be employed to 
                capture the flow phenomena near the surface accurately. One major limitation encountered in employing the MD method 
                is the requirement of immense computational resources in modeling realistic gas-surface interaction, which may render 
                it computationally prohibitive.</p>
                
                <p style="text-align: justify">Among various techniques that can be used to improve the flow accuracy near a surface, one straightforward approach 
                is to increase the accuracy of gas-surface interaction models. The primary parameters in gas-surface interaction 
                models that determine flow physics near a non-reactive surface are momentum and energy accommodation coefficients. 
                These coefficients are found to depend on many macroscopic as well as microscopic properties. As MD simulations 
                consider the interaction of real molecules (via interaction potential), the surface accommodation coefficients can 
                be determined accurately. In the proposed work, a systematic, step by step approach is presented first to calculate 
                surface accommodation coefficients using molecular dynamics simulations. Using non-linear regression analysis, 
                an empirical relationship connecting microscopic and macroscopic properties to surface accommodation coefficients 
                is obtained.

              <p style="text-align: justify">
                Designing nano-confined devices and investigating the gas flows in rarefied and micro-scale 
                conditions requires accurate estimation of non-conserved quantities, such as viscous stress and heat flux. 
                In the Knudsen layer region, where gas-wall interaction deviates from the classical Navier-Stokes-Fourier (NSF) 
                formulations, higher-order accurate constitutive relations are necessary to determine the appropriate dynamics. 
                This study aims to examine the deviations occurring in continuum theories and explore flow dynamics in the 
                Knudsen Layer from an atomistic perspective. To achieve this goal, molecular dynamics simulations are conducted 
                on planar and cylindrical Couette flows with both mono-atomic and di-atomic gases at various Knudsen and Mach numbers.

              <h2>Icing and Anti-icing</h2>
              <p></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify">
                Ice formation on surfaces occurs when supercooled water droplet hits the surface, 
                where it loses energy and form ordered ice structures. To prevent ice formation, 
                researchers have been studying ways to develop materials that display a passive anti-icing property, 
                which repels the formation of ice on the surface. This involves a fundamental understanding of the interaction 
                between ice and surfaces, which has been studied using molecular dynamics simulations. In this study, 
                nano-spherical water droplets are used to investigate the hydrophobicity of various surfaces such as silicon, 
                silicon oxide, graphene, titanium oxide and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). The effects of surface roughness on 
                contact angle and hydrophobicity are also analyzed. The goal is to achieve super-hydrophobicity, and use these 
                materials as coating materials on the base surface, which is a highly desirable property for anti-icing materials. 
                The knowledge gained from these studies is being applied to the development of a hybrid 
                molecular dynamics-computational fluid dynamics (MD-CFD) solver. This solver will be used to efficiently handle 
                ice behavior on aircraft surfaces and other applications in the aviation industry, power transmission, and 
                wind turbines. The goal is to develop materials that can withstand harsh weather conditions and reduce the 
                risks associated with ice formation on surfaces.

              <h2>Nanoscale-pumping</h2>
              <p></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify">
                Nano-scale water pumping through carbon nanotubes is an area of active research due to the need for efficient 
                fluid transportation at the nanoscale level. Molecular dynamics simulations are commonly used to study the behavior
                of fluids flowing through carbon nanotubes and to understand the underlying physics of the process. In this present 
                study, the use of coaxially rotating carbon nanotubes has been proposed as a novel and energy-efficient mechanism for 
                pumping water through nanodevices. It was observed that the coaxially rotating carbon nanotubes induce fluid flow due 
                to their rotational motion, resulting in significantly higher flow rates when compared to systems that possess only a 
                single chiral rotating carbon nanotube. These studies were carried out for two fluids, water and argon.

              <h2>Sintering</h2>
              <p></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify">
                Studies on rocket motors have demonstrated that combustion
                efficiency enhances with the addition of aluminum nano
                particles, which can significantly boost motor performance.
                However, agglomeration of aluminum particles reduces combustion
                efficiency, which is countered by coating them with thin layers
                of nickel atoms. With the aim to understand the sintering and
                coating process from molecular perspective, molecular dynamics
                simulations were employed to study nickel and aluminum nano
                particles. It was observed that nickel and aluminum
                nanoparticles, when placed in close proximity, they coalesce
                into a single spherical nickel aluminide particle by releasing
                substantial amounts of energy. Additionally, shell sintering was
                examined by coating nickel with aluminum, revealing that the
                stability of the shell is dependent on the thickness of the
                nickel coating. Moreover, the critical thickness of the coating
                is found to hinder the sintering process.

              <h2>Sputtering </h2>
              <p></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify">
                Sputtering is a process in which high-energy particles collide with a solid surface and eject particles from the 
                surface. In the context of ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor), one of the major challenges is 
                finding a plasma-facing material (PFM) that can withstand the high energy from fusion reactions and the impact of 
                dust particles. To better understand this process, we have used molecular dynamics simulations to study sputtering 
                and crater formation on the PFM surface when subjected to low to high-energy dust particles. The dust particles 
                ranged in size from a few to a thousand atoms, and their impact on the PFM was analyzed to determine the 
                characteristics of the resulting craters. By studying the behavior of dust particles on the surface of different 
                materials, one can identify the most suitable materials for plasma-facing components that can withstand the harsh 
                conditions of fusion reactions.
